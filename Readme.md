--How do I approach designing software?

Designing software takes multiple steps. First, requirements are needed so the scope of the project and what it needs to accomplish is known and understood. After gathering the requirements, break down the software into multiple bite-size pieces, and start chipping away.
During the creation of the software, keep focused on the requirements to ensure the project is aligned with what is needed or expected.

--What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Learning how to use OpenGL will be a tremendous help as it will allow for more advanced graphical work in my career and side projects.

--What design process did you follow for your project work?

Understanding the rubric and what was expected helped craft and shape what was designed. During the entire development time, I made sure I was aligned with the rubric.

--What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Working on a project of this scale, using OOP was a must. Ensuring all aspects of the code coincided with one another was key in making a fully functional 3D scene.

--How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Coding with the goal of accomplishing small bite-size milestones allow for faster development times. These milestones are little pieces of the big picture, so with each milestone that is checked off, the final scene is closer and closer to completion. Tackling the entire
project without breaking it into pieces would not give the same results, as it would lose cohesiveness.
